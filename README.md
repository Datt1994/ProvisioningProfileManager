Provisioning Profile Manager
============================

Simple Mac app for managing local Xcode provisioning profiles.

With Xcode 7, profile management turned into a special kind of hell. You are not able to delete profiles from within Xcode anymore, and updated profiles show up as duplicates once you sync with the developer portal.

In addition, two profiles with the same name will appear as a single option in the profile picker, making it virtually impossible to select the new one.

Profile Manager aims to ease the management of local provisioning profiles by parsing and displaying them in an easy to browse list, where you can delete the old ones with a single click.
